# Habit Tracker for Obsidian

A powerful habit tracking plugin for Obsidian that helps you build and maintain daily habits with streaks, progress tracking, and an intuitive interface. **All your habit data is stored as markdown notes** in your vault for maximum transparency and portability.

## Features

- 📋 **Track Multiple Habits** - Create and manage as many habits as you need
- 📝 **Note-Based Storage** - Each habit is saved as a markdown file you can view and edit
- 🔥 **Streak Tracking** - See how many consecutive days you've maintained each habit
- 📊 **Progress Visualization** - View your daily completion rate with a visual progress bar
- 📅 **Calendar View** - 7-week calendar visualization in the history modal
- 🎨 **Customizable** - Set colors for individual habits and customize your tracking experience
- 💡 **Habit Suggestions** - Get inspiration from built-in suggestions or add your own
- ⚡ **Quick Access** - Ribbon icon and commands for easy access to your habits
- 📂 **Organized** - All habits stored in a dedicated folder (default: `Habits/`)

## How It Works 

Each habit is stored as a **markdown note** in your vault with:
- **Frontmatter** containing metadata (ID, color, creation date, etc.)
- **Heading** with the habit name
- **Description** (optional)
- **Completions list** showing all your check-ins with dates

Example habit note (`Habits/Exercise.md`):
```markdown
---
id: 1707734400000-abc123
name: Exercise for 30 minutes
description: Morning workout routine
color: #4a9eff
createdAt: 2026-02-01T08:00:00.000Z

# Exercise for 30 minutes

- 2026-02-12 ✓
- 2026-02-11 ✓
- 2026-02-10 ✗

This means you can:
